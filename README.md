# IBM Call for Code Challenge 2021

Climate change challenges proposed by IBM:

1. Zero hunger
2. Responsible production and green consumption 
3. Clean water and sanitation

## Short description

We've decided to tackle the challenge of responsible production and green consumption. Majority of electronic products end up in landfills, and only 20% of e-waste is recycled. According to a UN study, about 50 million tons of e-waste was discarded worldwide. Currently, 50%–80% of e-waste that recyclers collect is exported overseas, the inadequate management of electronics recycling in developing countries has led to various health and environmental problems. We propose a blockchain-based E-waste trading platform where users can sell their old electronics or parts that they want to recycle tagged with an ID to their producer (an electronic manufacturing company) and receive a reward in exchange. To provide transparency, sellers can track their products to see where they’ll end up and ensure that the producer is ethically handling their e-waste; this will enable them to track the lifecycle of their products. 

The project is inspired by [Idea #4](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Production-2021#idea-4) for efficient waste collection:

| Who               | What                                                               | How                                                                                    |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A product user    | can publish parts or goods they want to recycle                    | by publishing the information on a repository, with product/part ID, address, and date |
| A waste collector | can reserve their waste to collect and organize their pick-up tour | by accessing the repository                                                            |
