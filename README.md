# IBM Call for Code Challenge 2021

Climate change challenges proposed by IBM:

1. Zero hunger
2. Responsible production and green consumption 
3. Clean water and sanitation

## Description

We've decided to tackle the challenge of responsible production and green consumption. Majority of electronic products end up in landfills, and only 20% of e-waste is recycled. According to a UN study, about 50 million tons of e-waste was discarded worldwide. Currently, 50%–80% of e-waste that recyclers collect is exported overseas, the inadequate management of electronics recycling in developing countries has led to various health and environmental problems. We propose a blockchain-based E-waste trading platform where users can sell their old electronics or parts that they want to recycle tagged with an ID to their producer (an electronic manufacturing company) and receive a reward in exchange. To provide transparency, sellers can track their products to see where they’ll end up and ensure that the producer is ethically handling their e-waste; this will enable them to track the lifecycle of their products.
